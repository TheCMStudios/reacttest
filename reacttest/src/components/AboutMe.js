                        <h3>Hopscotch</h3>
                        <p>I love to code on Hopscotch. I code a bunch of different types of games and some trail arts rarely, and the prject/game I'm most proud of is dodge 3. My most popular game on Hopscotch is Mr. Tickles with almost 50k plays and over 1.6k likes. You can find me on the Hopscotch app as "TheCMStudios"

                        <h3>Forum</h3>
                        <p>I have a job as a leader on the Hopscotch forum. It's a non-paid, volunteered job, but I love every bit of it and I'm on there every day under the name "TheCMStudios". I am in a lead team with 3 others and we do all sorts of stuff like Hopscotch coding challenges, moderating the forum, making sure everything is organized and appropriate for kids around 6-12 years old. How I also help out is with helping these kids with their Hopscotch projects and giving them advice on how they can improve.</p>

                        <h3>Outside Hopscotch</h3>
                        <p>As everyone has a "life" on the internet, they also have one outside. I did a bunch of Cross Country in middle school and high school and I ran it for 6 years. As of 2020, I am a senior in high school taking dual enrollment and going to a second school for work based learning. So I pretty much go to 3 different schools which seems like a lot but I really only have 5 classNamees compared to 7 as the amount of classNamees you would have if you were only taking high school classNamees. I do a bunch of HTML and CSS learning on my own time and this website is something I've been working on for a while now and this is what it turned into.</p>
